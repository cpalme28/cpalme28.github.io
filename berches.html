                    Brenda is the middle kid of her siblings. She met Eric in high school, just like her other two 
                    siblings. The two of them have two children of their own, Sami and Sidnee. In 2008, the four
                    of them moved from Arizona to Florida, where Eric launched a finance company with his two brothers.
                    In 2022, Sami married Marcello and the two of them are expecting their first child to be born in
                    March 2026. Sidnee curently lives in Ohio where she works for the Cincinatti Bengals.

                    Following her love of sports, Sidnee continues to work for the Cincinatti Bengals. She started
                    in the organization as an assistant, but is now the director of Social Media management and
                    works closely with the marketing department. She loves every moment of cheering on her Bengals,
                    despite the ups and downs of the season. <br><br>

                    She started her career in sports at the Jacksonville Gladiators, an ECHL team in Georgia. She 
                    soon moved up with that organization before she got the opportunity to work for the Bengals.
                    We are all so proud of her and can't wait to see what she does next!

                    Sami and Marcello are expecting their first child in March of 2026! The two of them are 
                    over the moon excited to be parents and can't wait to meet their little one. We are all
                    so excited to welcome a new member to the Berch family! <br><br>

                    The couple first told their immediate families before Brenda and Sami shared the news with
                    Nana and Papa. Not known for being able to keep secrets this big a secret, they were 
                    thrilled and shared the news with the rest of the family in Arizona. <br><br>

                    In October, Sami and Marcello announced their their first child is going to be a girl.
                    As Nate and Christian said, "Why aren't there more girls in the family!" as the two of them
                    are the only male grandchildren.
