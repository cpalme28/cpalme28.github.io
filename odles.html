                <p>
                    After working as a behaviorial specialist at Tolleson High School for seven years, Nate is 
                    making moves. He still is going to be working at Tolleson High School, but now he is going
                    to be one of their IT specialists. While still in the same educational realm, this is a big
                    step forward for him in his career. Congratulations Nate!

                <summary>Alexis celebrates 12 years as a teacher!</summary>
                <p>
                    From a young age, Alexis always knew that she wanted to be a teacher and to help kids with
                    their schooling. She has been teaching for 12 years now, and she is currently the lead teacher
                    at her school for children with special needs. Her dedication to her students is inspiring to
                    and we are all so proud of her! <br><br>

                    She started working in the kindergarten classroom, but she has found her place working with 
                    special needs children. It is not always easy, but not even the toughest days can keep her
                    down. Keep up the great work Alexis!
